Displays a menu where you can choose the shape of your paintbrush.<p>
Paintbrushes are sorted by family. You can see some paintbrushes of the same family but with different sizes. There is at least one paint-brush from each family displayed in this menu. Here is the list of all the different paintbrush families:<p>
*******      ***      * * * *      * * *******     *****      * * *      * * * *******    *******    * * * *    * * * * *******    *******     * * *      * * * *******    *******    * * * *    * * * * *******     *****      * * *      * * * *******      ***      * * * *      * *<p>

When using one of these, you can change the brush size by using the keys:<p>
Other brushes are bitmaps, their size can&#39;t be adjusted.<p>
Click with left mouse button to choose a paintbrush, and right mouse button to store your current brush in the slot. If your current brush is a grabbed brush, it will store a monochrome version of it, maximum 15x15. (See below &#39;Brush container&#39; to store backups of a big brush) The stored brushes are saved when you exit the program.<p>
The &#39;Preset&#39; button allows you to pick a brush from any family. It&#39;s useful if you&#39;ve overwritten all normal slots with brushes that you use more often.<p>

</blockquote>
<p>
The bottom row, initially showing empty buttons, is the brush container. You can right-click a button to store the current brush in it, and then whenever you need the brush back, open this menu again and left-click the button. The container can memorize resizable brushes as well as brushes grabbed from the image. Brushes are lost when you exit the program.<p>

<p>
Transforms your current user-defined brush into a paintbrush. This is actually a "monochromisation" of your user-defined brush. This means that every color of the brush that aren&#39;t the Back-color will be set to the Fore-color. But this option doesn&#39;t alter the brush: you&#39;ll just have to right-click on the "Get brush" buttons to get your brush back.<p>
Note: When you press (not in the menu) the paintbrush becomes the smallest member of the "Disc" family: i.e one pixel.</div>

<p>
Allows you to scroll the picture to re-center your graph for example.<p>
Any part of the picture that goes out of the image by a side comes back by the opposite one.<p>
Left clicking the picture will scroll only the active layer. Right-clicking will scroll all of them.<p>

<div class="display">
<code class="lit">RESCALE</code></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Allows you to change the image&#39;s size, rescaling it accordingly. Enter new size and press RESIZE to confirm.<p>
When &#39;Lock proportions&#39; is checked and you change one dimension, the other one is automatically adjusted to preserve the proportions of the original image.<p>
You can use the dropdown button to choose between three ways to enter the dimensions:<p>
In &#39;Pixels&#39; mode, the column &#39;old&#39; shows the original dimensions, and you can set the new size in pixels.<p>
In &#39;Percent&#39; mode, you set a percentage compared to the original image.<p>
In &#39;Ratio&#39; mode, you can set 2 numbers for each dimension, and the resizing factor will be of &#39;new&#39;&#39;old&#39;. For example you can use 1:3 to divide the image by three, 2:1 to double it, and any fraction like 15:16.<p>
Be careful that moving from one mode to the next can lose precision, if the selected dimensions cannot be represented exactly in the new mode.<p>

<p>
Selects the current hand-drawing mode as the active drawing tool. There are 4 hand-drawing modes:<p>
Continuous hand-drawing: as you move the mouse, the paintbrush is regularily pasted on the picture. This drawing tool allows to change the fore and back colors when being in use.<p>
Discontinuous hand-drawing: as you move the mouse, the paintbrush is pasted on the picture every time a delay is passed (actually, the delay is 1 VBL (vertical blanking)). This drawing tool allows to change the fore and back colors when being in use.<p>
Dot by dot hand-drawing: the paintbrush is only pasted at the position where you first clicked.<p>
Contour fill: Draws pixels like continuous mode, but when you release the button Grafx2 draws a line back to your starting position, and fills the area. This tool doesn&#39;t use the current brush, but single pixels.<p>

<p>
Selects the current curve-drawing mode as the active drawing tool. There are 2 different curve-drawing modes:<p>
* 4 control points curves: define the basic line like a classical line, then move, with the left mouse button, the inner control points to choose the shape of your curve. When the curve has the shape you want, click with the right mouse button to draw it definitively.<p>
* 3 control points curves: the same as above, but you&#39;ll have only one inner control point to place. Moreover, the spline will be traced just after placing this point.<p>

<div class="display">
<code class="lit">LEFT CLICK</code></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Selects the current line-drawing mode as the active drawing tool. There are 3 line-drawing modes:<p>
* Classical lines: when first clicking on the picture, you&#39;ll define the start of the line. Maintain your click to choose the end of the line and release the mouse button to set it. If you hold SHIFT when drawing, the line will be constrained to horizonal, vertical or diagonal.<p>
* Knotted lines: works like classical lines, but the end of your line will automatically become the start of the next one. When you want to stop chaining lines, use the opposite mouse button. "The opposite button" means that if you started to draw lignes with the left button (Fore-color), you&#39;ll have to stop the procedure with the right button; and conversely.<p>
* Concentric lines: when first clicking on the picture, you&#39;ll define center of the lines. In fact, the center is defined by the the position of the mouse when you release the mouse button. Then you can draw lines from the center to the current mouse position by clicking. To stop drawing concentric lines, use the opposite mouse button. This drawing tool allows to change the fore and back colors when being in use.<p>

Displays a menu where you can configure the spray:<p>
- Size: Defines the diameter of the circle in which will effectively fit the spray.<p>
- Delay: Defines the number of VBLs that will be waited for between two flows of spray.<p>
- Mode: Defines whether you want to use a monochrome spray or a multi- colored one.<p>
- Mono-flow: Defines the number of paintbrushes that will be pasted in the circle of the spray at each cycle.<p>
- Palette: Left-click on a color of the palette to see how much it will be used in the multicolored flow, and modify it by using the gauge on the right. If the flow of this color was equal to 0, then the "Init" value will be applied. Or set the flow of a color to 0 by clicking on it with the right mouse button.<p>
- Clear: Removes all the colors from the multicolored flow. Actually, this puts a 0 value in the use of each color.<p>
- Init: Allows you to define a value that will be set to the color you click on in the palette if its value is equal to 0. This permits to tag a set of colors more quickly.<p>
- +1,-1,x2,/2: Modify the values of all the tagged colors (and only them).<p>
Tip: If you often use the Shade mode, and are bored to click many times on a color to reach the color you want, you can define a spray with "Size"=1, "Mono-flow"=1, and "Delay"=2 (or more, according to your reflexes). And then, you&#39;ll just have to click a few hundredths of second to modify a color.</div>

Any rule has its exceptions and this one doesn&#39;t depart from that. Indeed, this tool is the only one to be affected by no effect (except Stencil) and to be able to modify non visible parts of the picture. The function of this tool being replacing all the occurences of a color in the picture by another, if would have been a shame to limit modifications only to the visible part of the picture.</div>

Rotates the brush by an angle of 90 degrees.<p>
Rotates the brush by an angle of 180 degrees.<p>
- Rotate by any angle: Triggers an interactive operation that allows you to rotate the brush. For this, start by placing the center or rotation with the left mouse button (if, at this moment, you press the right button, the operation with be cancelled). After that, you can define the angle of rotation as many times as you want by moving the mouse and left-clicking. Then validate with the right button when you are satisfied. Meanwhile, you can press on the 8 outer digits of the numeric pad for defining angles multiple of 45 degrees:<p>
135     90      45 \     |     / &#39;7&#39; &#39;8&#39; &#39;9&#39; 180  -&#39;4&#39;     &#39;6&#39;- 0 &#39;1&#39; &#39;2&#39; &#39;3&#39; /     |     \ 225     270    315<p>
Triggers an interactive operation that enables you to stretch the brush. For this, start by placing the upper-left cornerof the brush with the left mouse button (if, at this moment, you press the right button, the operation will be cancelled). after that, you can place the opposite corner as many times as you need, then validate with the right mouse button when you are satisfied. If you place this point at coordinates inferior to the ones of the first point, the brush will be inverted. Meanwhile, you can press the following keys whose effects are: &#39;D&#39;      : Double the brush &#39;H&#39;      : Reduce the brush by half &#39;X&#39;      : Double the brush in X &#39;Shift+X&#39;: Reduce the brush by half in X &#39;Y&#39;      : Double the brush in Y &#39;Shift+Y&#39;: Reduce the brush by half in Y &#39;N&#39;      : Restore the normal size of the brush (can be useful because it&#39;s the only way for cancelling)<p>
Triggers an interactive operation that allows you to distort your brush. Start by placing the brush somewhere on the screen and left-click. The brush will appear, with a little peg at each corner. Use the left mouse button to displace the corners, which will deform the brush. When you&#39;re done, click the right mouse button.<p>
This option permits to draw the outlines of the brush with the Fore- color.<p>

In this menu, the "All off" button switches all the drawing modes off.   The [Del] key is the keyboard shortcut for this button. The "Feedback" button is only used in "Shade", "Quick-shade, "Transparency" and "Smooth" modes. When it is set, it means that the _current_   state of the picture has to be taken into account for the effect instead   of the state in which the image was when you started to click for drawing.

Opens a menu where you can define one table of shades within a range of 8 memorised by the program. The different sections of this menu are:<p>
- Palette: You can define in it the color blocks that will be inserted into the table of shades.<p>
- Scroller: Used to change flick through the tables of shades.<p>
- Table of shades definition area: The 512 squares should be widely sufficient to define the different shades since every 256 colors of the palette cannot be present more than once in each table.<p>
- A window (on the top-right side) permits to visualize the different shades defined in he current table.<p>
- Copy: Copy the contents of the table in a buffer. (Each time you open this menu, the current table is automatically transfered into this buffer).<p>
- Paste: Copy the contents of the buffer above in the current table.<p>
- Clear: Reset the "shades" table.<p>
- Insert: Used to insert the block selected in the palette at the cursor&#39;s position in the table of shades. IF you click with the left mouse button on this button THEN IF a block of more than one color is selected in the table THEN   It is deleted and the block defined in the palette is inserted. ELSE   The block defined in the palette is inserted at the postion just before the selected square. END IF ELSE The block defined in the palette is inserted by erasing the colors following the beginning of the bloc selected in the table. END IF<p>
- Delete: Delete the block selected in the table.<p>
- Blank: Follows this algorithm: IF you click with the left mouse button on this button THEN Replace the block selected in the table by blank squares. ELSE IF a block of more than one color is selected in the table THEN   Insert blank squares to the left and to the right of the block.   (this is useful for isolating a shade quickly) ELSE   Insert blank squares to the left of the selected square. END IF END IF<p>
- Invert: Invert the order of the block selected in the table.<p>
- Swap: Allows you you move a block (this exchanges it with what is where you want to move it).<p>
- Undo: Cancel the last modification of the table.<p>
- The 2 numbers displayed on the right of these buttons are: (above) - the number of the color selected in the palette if only one color is selected. (below) - the number of the color contained in a square in the shades table if this square is the only one selected.<p>
- The "mode" button displays 3 different modes: "Normal": Shades in the range and saturates to its boundaries. "Loop": Shades in the range and loops if boundaries are passed. "No saturation": Shades in the range and doesn&#39;t saturate if boundaries are passed. If the Step (see below) is set to 1, this option does exactly the same as the Normal mode.<p>
- Set/Disable: If you want to define several shades in the same table but you&#39;d like these shades not to be effective at the same time, you can mask (disable) some parts of the table so that they will be interpreted a blank squares. To do that, select a block in the table of shades and click on "Set". The block will be underlined with a white line; this means that it is disabled.<p>
- Clear/Enable: This does exactly the opposite as the button above.<p>
- Step: Defines the step of incrementation of the shade. The bigger, the faster you run through the colors of the shade. For example: if the step is 2 and that you have defined a shade with the colors 0,1,4,5,9 and that you click on a pixel of color 1, it will take the value 5 which is 2 positions next in the la table.<p>

When you draw on a color of the image which is between the fore- and the back-color in the palette, the color tends towards the fore-color   (according to the step defined) if you draw with the left mouse button, or   it tends towards the back-color if you are using the right mouse button.<blockquote style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;">

For example, draw a simple white figure on a black background in the   spare page. Then, tag the black color in the menu of the Mask mode. When   you&#39;ll draw in the current page, only the pixels corresponding to the   white (non-black) ones in the spare page will be modified.<blockquote style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;">

- 12 default patterns: They can be copied to the drawing area.<p>
- "Transfer to brush": Copies the pattern to the brush (white pixels =&gt; Fore-color / black pixels =&gt; Back-color).<p>
- "Get from brush": Puts the brush into the drawing area (back-color =&gt; black pixels / others =&gt; white pixels).<p>
- Scrolling 4-arrows pad: Scrolls the pattern in the drawing area.<p>
- Resizing 4-arrows pad: Defines the dimensions of the pattern.<p>
- Default-value (black or white square): Indicates which value must be inserted when you increase the dimensions of the pattern.<p>

- Interpolation rate: Indicates the percentage of the applied color that will be considered upon the replaced color.<p>
- Interpolation method: Uses an interpolation algorithm to compute the color, according to the interpolation rate.<p>
- Additive method: Uses the lightest colors to choose the color to apply. For example: if you want to apply a color RGB:30,20,40 on a color RGB:10,50,20, the color applied will be the one, in the palette, that is the closest to the theoretic color RGB:30,50,40.<p>
- Subtractive method: uses the darkest colors to choose the color to apply. For example: if you want to apply a color RGB:30,20,40 on a color RGB:10,50,20, the color applied will be the one, in the palette, that is the closest to the theoretic color RGB:10,20,20.</div>

<div class="display">
<code class="lit">LEFT CLICK</code></div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Displays a menu where you can define the size of your picture and choose the screen resolution.<p>
- Image size Click in the boxes named "Width" and "Height" to change the size of the image you&#39;re editing, up to 9999x9999. You can also right-click a video mode to copy its dimensions to the image&#39;s.<p>
- Pixel size If you choose any Pixel size other than Normal, Grafx2 will emulate a lower resolution by scaling up everything it displays, including the menus and mouse cursor. In Double, Triple and Quadruple mode, the image will appear zoomed x2, x3 or x4, keeping the original proportions. The scaling is done in software, with no linear interpolation, so it can&#39;t cause blur. This setting is especially useful if your hardware or drivers don&#39;t support the low resolutions you need, but it also allows you to draw in low-resolution while staying in window mode. If you choose one of the scalers called Wide, Tall, Wide2 and Tall2, this will emulate a video mode which has rectangular pixels (longer horizontally or vertically), like some video modes of the C64, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore Amiga.<p>
- Video mode Click on a video mode to select it. Grafx2 only lists modes that are detected as available on your computer. Depending on your video card and drivers, there can be a huge difference in the number of modes it can propose. The small buttons on the left-hand side of the lines in the list of modes have been designed to allow you to disable some modes that are not supported by your card. So, the modes that you will disable won&#39;t be used when loading pictures with "Auto-set resolution" ON.<p>
When you click on one of these buttons, its color changes to one of the 4 following. The signification for each color of these buttons is:<p>
- Light gray: The video mode is OK. It can be used by the auto-set resolution option when you load picture, and you can select it in the menu of resolutions.<p>
- White: It works exactly the same as above. Moreover, it allows you to tag your favourite modes. Indeed, the huge number of video modes makes it more difficult to find the mode your want in the list; so you can tag your favoutite ones in white, so that it will be easier to locate them. (Note: you cannot disable the standard windowed mode)<p>
- Dark gray: It allows you to indicate which modes are not really perfect (flickering, not centered, etc...) but which can be used even so. The difference with the light grey button is that these modes won&#39;t be used by the auto-set resolution option.<p>
- Black: Use it for totally unsupported modes. Thus, these modes won&#39;t be selected the "auto-set res." and the program will not let you select them from the list of resolutions.<p>

- numbers below the gauges: Allows you to type in a new color in hexadecimal RRGGBB or RGB: ie. to get blue, you can type either 0000ff or 00f.<p>
- "+" and "-": Allow you to lighten or darken the current selection.<p>
- Preset: Restores the predefined GrafX2 palette.<p>
- Gray: Transforms the current selection into its gray-scaled equivalent.<p>
- Neg: Transforms the current selection into its reverse video equivalent.<p>
- Invert: Swaps the colors of the current selection so that the first colors become the last ones.<p>
- X-Invert: Works as above but modifies the picture so that it looks the same.<p>
- Swap: Swaps the current selection with another color-block. Click on the beginning of the new color-block.<p>
- X-Swap: Works as above but modifies the picture so that it looks the same. This may be useful if you want to sort your palette.<p>
- Copy: Copies the current selection to another color-block. Click on the beginning of the new color-block.<p>
- Spread: Computes a gradation between two colors. If your selection is only made up of one color, select the second color in the palette. Otherwise, the two colors used will be its extremities.<p>
- Sort: sorts the palette by color ranges. If you click with the left mouse button, it will sort by H S L; and if you click with the right mouse button, it will sort by L only. Note that you can choose a range of colors before sorting, and instead of the whole palette it will sort this range.<p>
- Used: Indicates the number of colors used in the picture and opens a histogram screen.<p>
- Zap unused: Erases the unused colors with copies of the current selection. (The keyboard shortcut for this button is &lt;Del&gt;).<p>
- Reduce: Allows you to reduce the palette to the number of colors you want (and modifies the picture).<p>
- Undo: Allows you to recover the last modifications made on the palette. Note that it can&#39;t undo the changes that affect the pixels (remapping), you&#39;ll need to Cancel them.<p>
If you press &lt;Backspace&gt;, the program will replace, as well as possible, some unused colors by the four default colors of the menu. The image won&#39;t look altered because the modified colors (in the case they were used on a few points) will be replaced by the closest colors in the rest of the palette. This option is really useful when you modify the palette so that there are no colors that fit for the menu (eg: "Zap unused" while very little colors are used in the picture; or "Reduce" with a very small number of colors).<p>
If you press the key below &lt;Escape&gt; or &lt;,&gt; (QWERTY), the menu will disappear and you will be able to pick up a color from the picture easily. Press &lt;Escape&gt; to cancel.<p>
If only one color is selected (not a block), the &lt;[&gt; and &lt;]&gt; keys can be used to select the previous or next Forecolor (Backcolor if you press &lt;Shift&gt; at the same time).<p>
Warning! If you press Undo after an action that modifies the picture (X-Swap, X-Invert and Reduce colors), the picture won&#39;t be remapped as it was just before this action. Only Cancel will.</div>

<p>
Opens a menu from where you have the following options:<p>
- Colors for best match: A menu in which you can select the colors that have not to be used for smoothing, for the transparency mode, and for remapping.<p>
- User&#39;s color series: A menu in which you can define color series for next/previous user color shortcuts. It&#39;s the same settings than the shade mode. After you have some color ranges defined in this screen, you can use those shortcuts to move to the next or previous color according to your ranges:<p>
Foreground color<p>
Background color<p>
- Palette layout: Lets you customize the palette that appears on the right of the menu. You can choose the number of lines and columns. If you want the colors to run top to bottom, check the &#39;Vertical&#39; button, otherwise the colors runs left to right.<p>
- RGB Scale: Lets you set the scale of the R G B sliders in the palette screen. You should normally leave it at 256 to get the full 0-255 range, but if you want to constrain the palette to the capabilities of some specific computers and consoles, you can choose eg: 64 : VGA 16 : Amiga 4 : MSX2 2 : Amstrad CPC</div>
